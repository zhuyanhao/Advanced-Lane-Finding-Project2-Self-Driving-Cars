## Advanced Lane Finding

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)
This is the second project of [Udacity's Self Driving Car Nano Degree Program](https://www.udacity.com/drive). The goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the road lane boundaries in a video. The effect of lightness is minimized and the lane could either be straight or curved.

**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Camera Calibration

The function `calibrate_camera` comutes the calibration and distortion coefficients using all the chessboard images provided in /camera_cal. It uses the "object points" that are reasonably specified by me and the "image points" detected by OpenCV. Then the function `cv2.calibrateCamera()` computes the matrix and coefficients we need. These numbers can be used to undistort the image and below is a simple example:

#### Generate Binary Image

The binary image is generated by function `create_binary_image`. This is the most critical step. I started with a combination of x-gradient and s channel thresholding as demonstrated by the lecture. It works quite well for all the test images given; however, the detection in the video looks quite unstable even with smoothing. 

Among those unstable detection, most are caused by the stains on the road, whose x-gradient magnitude is comparable to that of lane edges. To overcome this, a combination of RGB and HSL color space is used to make sure that the pixel marked is actually yellow or white. Also, the ideas of limiting the gradient direction I proposed in project 1 is introduced to further refine the detection. Therefore, the pixels in the binary image is set to 1 if:

    1. It is in the region of interest (defined by polygon mask)
    2. It is either white or yellow (S channel in HSL and R,G channel in RGB are used)
    3. The direction of gradient is within some angles of the horizontal line
    4. The x-gradient is large enough

`sobel_thresh` computes the x-gradient mask; `dir_threshold` computes the gradient direction mask and `create_binary_image` generates the binary image. A sample binary image is given below:

#### Perspective Transform

To generate the transform matrix (and its inverse), I first plot the undistorted image and pick four points manually (source points). Matplotlib gives me the coordinates of pixel. Then the coordinates of destination points are provided to function `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform`. Function 'perspective_transform' does the calculation for you and below is the a bird's-eye view of binary image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
